# React 19 + Vite Guide

Comprehensive guidelines for building React 19 SPA applications with Vite. Combines composition patterns, performance optimization, and web interface best practices into a single reference optimized for AI agent workflows.

## Tech Stack

- **React 19** — `use()`, ref as prop, React Compiler support
- **Vite** — `React.lazy()` + dynamic `import()`, env variables, HMR
- **TypeScript** — strict mode recommended
- **Pure SPA (CSR)** — no SSR, no hydration concerns

## Capability Index

### 1. Composition Patterns (references/composition-patterns.md)

Component architecture and state management patterns for scalable React apps.

| Priority | Category | Impact |
|----------|----------|--------|
| 1 | Component Architecture | HIGH |
| 2 | State Management | MEDIUM |
| 3 | Implementation Patterns | MEDIUM |
| 4 | React 19 APIs | MEDIUM |

Key topics:
- Boolean prop proliferation vs composition alternatives
- Compound components with shared context
- State management decoupled from UI via providers
- Generic context interfaces (state/actions/meta)
- State lifted into providers for sibling access
- Explicit component variants vs boolean modes
- Children vs render props
- React 19: `use()` replaces `useContext()`, ref as regular prop

### 2. Performance Optimization (references/performance-optimization.md)

Performance optimization patterns adapted for Vite + React 19 SPA. Next.js-specific patterns removed; Vite equivalents provided.

| Priority | Category | Impact |
|----------|----------|--------|
| 1 | Async Optimization | CRITICAL |
| 2 | Bundle Size | CRITICAL |
| 3 | Client-Side Data Fetching | MEDIUM-HIGH |
| 4 | Re-render Optimization | MEDIUM |
| 5 | Rendering Performance | MEDIUM |
| 6 | JavaScript Performance | LOW-MEDIUM |
| 7 | Advanced Patterns | LOW |

Key topics:
- `Promise.all()` and dependency-based parallelization
- `React.lazy()` + `Suspense` for code splitting (Vite)
- Barrel file import cost and direct imports
- Hover/focus preloading for perceived speed
- SWR for client-side data deduplication
- Functional `setState`, lazy state initialization
- `useTransition` for non-urgent updates
- `content-visibility: auto` for long lists
- `useRef` for transient values
- Module-level caching patterns

### 3. Web Interface (references/web-interface.md)

UI/UX patterns for accessibility, forms, animation, performance, and content quality.

| Category | Focus |
|----------|-------|
| Accessibility | ARIA, semantic HTML, keyboard handlers |
| Focus States | `focus-visible`, no bare `outline-none` |
| Forms | `autocomplete`, correct `type`, paste allowed |
| Animation | `prefers-reduced-motion`, compositor-only props |
| Typography | Ellipsis, curly quotes, `tabular-nums` |
| Content Handling | Truncation, empty states, long content |
| Images | Explicit dimensions, lazy loading |
| Performance | Virtualization, no layout reads in render |
| Navigation & State | URL reflects state, deep-linkable UI |
| Touch & Interaction | `touch-action`, `overscroll-behavior` |
| Dark Mode | `color-scheme`, `theme-color` meta |
| Locale & i18n | `Intl.DateTimeFormat`, `Intl.NumberFormat` |

### 4. Vite-Specific Patterns (references/vite-specific.md)

Vite-specific configuration, conventions, and optimization patterns.

Key topics:
- Dynamic imports and code splitting with Vite
- Environment variables (`import.meta.env`)
- Vite plugin ecosystem (React SWC/Babel)
- Build optimization (`manualChunks`, `rollupOptions`)
- Alias and path resolution
- CSS Modules
